            <p>Hello Everyone, I am Victor from Lagos, Nigeria. I love learning about and trying
                out new technologies, visiting art museums and listening to good music. <br> <br>

                I have been a member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for
                over 21 years(basically all my life from birth ). My favorite quote from a
                church leader is "The past is behind--learn from it, the
                future is ahead--prepare for it, the present is here--live in it."
                by President Thomas S. Monson.</p>
